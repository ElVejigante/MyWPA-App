		<h1 class="header-background">About Weequahic Park Association</h1>
		<p>The Weequahic Park Association (WPA) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) community corporation founded in 1992 by a group of local long distance runners.  The WPA entered into a partnership with Essex County that enabled them to direct the management of Weequahic Park, implement capital improvements, and serve as stewards of the park.</p>
		<p>The WPA has been holding weekly Saturday morning meetings consistently for over twenty years.  Comprised of more than 100 members, the WPA has a goal of restoring Weequahic Park to be one of the finest parks in the country.  To this end WPA continues to sponsor educational, recreational and cultural events that give life to the park and raise awareness of the park as a great community asset.</p>
		<p>In a world where great and serious intentions must often bow to the harsh realities that face them, the Weequahic Park Association (WPA) points with pride to all that it has been able to accomplish in its effort to revitalize historic Weequahic Park. </p>
		<p>These achievements, such as the construction of a 2.2 miles long running track made from 100% post consumer product (recycled tires & sneakers) and urethane binding layer made of rubber granules; the improvement of the lake shoreline, using biodegradable coir coconut fiber rolls, storm quality water improvements.</p>
		<p>Over the past years, the Weequahic Park Association has developed an extensive proposal for the restoration of Weequahic Park.  The common chord that brings harmony and purpose to the Weequahic Park Association is an intense desire to witness the development of a world class park.</p>
		<p>The Weequahic Park Association has hosted successful social services programs, music and other cultural events, education and recreational programs, festivals, fireworks in the park and other activities.  WPA has institutionalized a road race in the park, initiated the planting of long absent flowers and replacement of dying trees, spurred the installation of a new exercise trail and the renovation of two children's playground-a project which the WPA spent three years advocating.</p>
		<p>The Weequahic Park Association invites everyone within or outside of the community to become involved with our effort to restore Weequahic Park.</p>
